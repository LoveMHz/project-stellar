The knowledge base is a collection of information that hasn't quite found a place in another guide/manual for Project Stellar.

## General
#### In-Game Reset Button Combo
``Left Stick Button + Right Stick Button + Full Left Trigger + Full Right Trigger``

#### Custom Dashboard Path

## Known Issues
### 100% Fan Speed
This is being investigated.

### Video signal lost at the end of Stellar updates on HDMI systems
Currently the Stellar board resets at the end of a firmware update causing HDMI video to drop. 

**Workaround:** Power-off the system at the end of the update process. It's safe to turn the system off when the output says so, or when the signal is lost.

**Workaround:** Reboot and try again

### Savings settings freezes system
Fixed in firmware version 1.0.2.

### FlashFXP
Connects but does not display any files.

## FAQ

#### What is 'Auto' fan speed?
Auto fan speed allows the SMC to control the system's fan speed. This is the same as stock.

#### What about INSERT feature?
The goal right now is making sure all orders ship out and everything is 100% stable before enabling or adding additional features.

#### Can the C:\xboxhd folder be removed?
Yes, the XboxHD+ app and patches are no longer needed. It's probably best to delete as not to confuse someone else later on.
